## Updating/Uninstalling

The installer ships with a binary called `maintenancetool` which can be used to update or uninstall the program.

## Alternative installations

### AppImage/DMG

AppImage and DMG versions are available under releases.

### Building from source

This is actually really simple: clone the repository, open the `.pro` file in QtCreator and build.
